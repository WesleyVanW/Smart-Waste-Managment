# SmartWasteManagment

SmartWasteManagment is a device which tracks a regular garbage bin indoor aswell as outdoor. The device is triggered when opening the lid and will send valuable data such as inside temperature, capacity and location to either LoRa or Dash7 gateways. This data will be able to be processed by a backend python script to further implement the visualization in ThingsBoard.
